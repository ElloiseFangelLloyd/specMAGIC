## [Unreleased]

### Added 
- Added the option to download and run with MODIS high-resolution land albedo maps, instead of the coarse landmaps available by default. [!1](https://github.com/dmidk/specMAGIC/pull/1) @irenelivia [!12](https://github.com/dmidk/specMAGIC/pull/12) @SimonKamuk
- Added the satellite `.toml` file to avoid hardcoded satellite-specific values. [!18](https://github.com/dmidk/specMAGIC/pull/18) @ElloiseFangelLloyd @KristianHMoller

### Changed
- Throw error message rather than silent failure in absorber interpolation. [!9](https://github.com/dmidk/specMAGIC/pull/9) @SimonKamuk
- Get the climatologies' grid spacing directly from axis rather than assume the cell-centred grid assumption. [!10](https://github.com/dmidk/specMAGIC/pull/10) @SimonKamuk
- Reworked `geo2MTGImage` function to work for other satellites as well as MTG. [!18](https://github.com/dmidk/specMAGIC/pull/18) @ElloiseFangelLloyd. 
- Use longitude of the subsatellite point in the `geo2Image` function to correctly calculate for satellites located at nonzero longitudes. [!20](https://github.com/dmidk/specMAGIC/pull/20) @KristianHMoller


## [v1.0.0]

Initial release of specMAGIC. The application calculates gloval horizontal irradiance (GHI) from input MTG-FCI satellite data. OpenMP is included for parallelism. A test dataset is provided alongside the requisite pre-processing. Post-processing utilities make simple plots of the available outputs: GHI, Direct Normal Irradiance (the beam component of GHI), Clear Sky Radiance, and Effective Cloud Albedo.
